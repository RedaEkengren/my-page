  <div class="about">
  <p>
    Ever since I was 5 years old I've been in love with computers.    
    For some strange reason—maybe as a form of teenage rebellion—I ended up in the vehicle program and trained to become a mechanic. 
    I also hold a diploma as a high-voltage technician for vehicles.
  </p>

  <p>
    But now I've returned to my roots—I'm currently studying a program at EC Utbildning called Cloud and Infrastructure Specialist. It feels fantastic to be back in the world of IT."

    I've always loved creating content, so I decided to start making some videos of my own on YouTube. 
    I’ve created a series about server administration that covers setting up Active Directory, GPOs, file servers, file shares with permissions, NAT, backups and shadow copies, as well as creating an admin account and disabling UAC. 
    The virtual machines in the series include domain controllers, a DHCP server, a router, Windows 10 machines, and a file server.
  </p>

    I'm two-thirds through my studies and currently looking for a place to do my LIA (learning in a work environment). I'm interested in Linux, server administration, Active Directory, Azure, Microsoft 365, and much more.
